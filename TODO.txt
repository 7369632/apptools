* Remove the enthought.undo use of enthought.debug which is causing this project
  to have a dependency on DevTools.

* Refactor out the usage of enthought.util.numerix to remove the dependency
  this module has on enthought.util.

* Refactor the state_pickler.py module to break the need to import
  enthought.tvtk at all.

* Check to see if this whole package is redundant with the
  enthought.envisage.resource code.  If so, let's minimize to one location.
