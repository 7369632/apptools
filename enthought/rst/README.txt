This package provides tools and graphical editor for working with
reStructured Text.

To use the reST editor, run 'python app.py'. 

Non-Windows users should use the qt4 Traits UI backend if possible,
because the builtin wx HTML renderer is very poor. Windows users can
use either backend; in the wx backend, Internet Explorer is used to
render the HTML.
